      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 10, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 10, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to Jot. By downloading, installing, or using the Jot iOS application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User" or "you") and Jot ("we," "us," or "our"). By using the App, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>2. License to Use the App</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Grant of License</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on iOS devices that you own or control for your personal, non-commercial use.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Restrictions</h3>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
        <li>Modify, adapt, or create derivative works of the App</li>
        <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels</li>
        <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of these Terms</li>
        <li>Sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or redistribute the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Open Source Components</h3>
      <p>
        Jot may include open-source software components governed by separate licenses. These licenses are available in the App's documentation and on our <a href="https://github.com/LarryAlexander/jot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts and Data</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
      <p>
        The App stores all notes, attachments, and settings locally on your device. You are solely responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Backing up your data (via the App's export or backup features)</li>
        <li>Securing your device (passcode, biometric authentication, etc.)</li>
        <li>Maintaining sufficient storage space on your device</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>We do not store your notes on our servers and cannot recover lost data.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        If you use AI features (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic), your data is transmitted to those providers according to their terms of service and privacy policies. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those policies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Terms of Service</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://openai.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI Terms of Use</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic Terms of Service</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 API Keys</h3>
      <p>
        If you provide your own API keys for AI providers, you are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeping your API keys secure</li>
        <li>Monitoring and paying for API usage directly with the provider</li>
        <li>Compliance with the provider's usage limits and terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are not responsible for charges incurred through your API keys.</p>

      <h2>4. AI Credits and Advertising</h2>
      <h3>4.1 AI Credits</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses a credit system to manage AI feature usage. Credits can be earned by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watching rewarded video ads (+5.0 credits)</li>
        <li>Viewing passive ads (Banner, RSS, Project styled ads: +0.5 credits each)</li>
        <li>App Open ads (+1.0 credit per day)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Credits are stored locally on your device and are <strong>non-transferable</strong>. We reserve the right to adjust credit values, costs, and earning mechanisms at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Advertisements</h3>
      <p>
        The App may display advertisements served by Google AdMob. By consenting to ads (via the User Messaging Platform dialog), you agree to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow AdMob to collect device data as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li>Comply with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may opt out of ads at any time in <strong>Settings → Ad Settings → Opt Out of Ads</strong>. Opting out will disable credit earning from ads.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        The App, including all code, design, text, graphics, logos, and other content (excluding user-generated notes), is owned by Jot and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Your Content</h3>
      <p>
        You retain all rights to the notes, attachments, and other content you create in the App ("Your Content"). By using AI features, you grant AI providers a limited license to process Your Content as necessary to provide the requested service. We do not claim ownership of Your Content.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
      </ul>

        THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, or offensive material. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or quality of AI-generated content. You are solely responsible for reviewing and verifying AI outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee that the App will be available at all times or that AI features will function without interruption. Third-party AI providers may experience downtime or service disruptions.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, JOT AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:

      <ul>
        <li>ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES</li>
        <li>LOSS OF DATA, NOTES, OR CONTENT</li>
        <li>LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE</li>
        <li>DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IF ANY).
      </p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jot and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of the App</li>
        <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
        <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
        <li>Your Content</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <h3>10.1 Termination by You</h3>
      <p>
        You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.
      </p>

      <h3>10.2 Termination by Us</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violation of these Terms</li>
        <li>Fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>10.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
      <p>
        Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete all copies. Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive (indemnification, disclaimers, limitation of liability) will continue to apply.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via an in-app notification or by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <h3>12.1 Governing Law</h3>

      <p>
        Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the App will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), rather than in court. You waive your right to a jury trial.
      </p>

      <h3>12.3 Exceptions</h3>
      <p>
        You may bring claims in small claims court if they qualify. Either party may seek injunctive relief in court to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>

      <h3>13.2 Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h3>13.3 Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision.
      </p>

      <h3>13.4 Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.
