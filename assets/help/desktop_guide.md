# Jot Desktop Guide

## Welcome
Jot is a local-first Markdown notes app. On desktop, it’s optimized for keyboard + mouse: menu bar commands, a left-side navigation rail, and quick actions.

## Navigation (Desktop)
- Use the left sidebar to switch between **Projects**, **Tasks**, **Notes**, and **Recordings**.
- Use Search (⌘F) to jump quickly.

## Menu Bar
Jot includes standard macOS menus:
- **Jot → Preferences…** (⌘,) opens Settings.
- **File → New Note** (⌘N) creates a new note.
- **File → Search** (⌘F) opens global search.
- **Help** contains links to this guide, keyboard shortcuts, and other resources.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
See: [Keyboard Shortcuts](shortcuts.md)

## Window Management
- Jot runs as a standard macOS windowed app.
- If you minimize/close, you can restore from the Dock (or system tray if enabled).

## Backups (and Recovery Key)
Jot supports encrypted backups. For safety, export and store your **Backup Recovery Key** somewhere secure (password manager recommended).

## Privacy Notes
- Jot stores notes locally.
- AI features may use local models or cloud providers depending on your settings.

## Troubleshooting
- If a feature says “Coming soon”, it’s intentionally disabled until polished.
- For issues, use **Help → Report an Issue…**.
