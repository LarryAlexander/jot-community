## Tips for Success

### ✅ Do This

- **Break into phases** - Makes progress visible
- **Set clear ownership** - Use @mentions
- **Add deadlines** - For real deadlines only
- **Update regularly** - Daily for active projects
- **Link related notes** - Use [[Note Name]]

### ❌ Avoid This

- Too many tasks at once (overwhelming!)

## Advanced: Import Projects

Already wrote your project in another app? Import it!

### From Markdown Files

1. Go to **Settings → Data Management → Import**
2. Select your `.md` file
3. Jot imports it as a note
4. Create a project and link the note

### From Other Apps

- **Notion/Obsidian**: Export as markdown
- **Emails**: Copy/paste into new note
- **Documents**: Convert to markdown first

### Pro Tip: Templates

Create a project template once, export it, and reuse it for similar projects!

## FAQ

**Can I have multiple projects?**
Yes! Create as many as you need. Use tags to organize them.

**Can others collaborate?**
Currently Jot is single-user. You can share by exporting and sending the markdown file.

**What if I don't know all the tasks yet?**
That's fine! Start with big phases, add tasks as you go.

**Can I track time or budgets?**
Add those as custom notes sections for now. Dedicated tracking coming later.
