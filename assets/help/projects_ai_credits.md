# Projects AI: Credits & Ads

Understand how credits and ad rewards work when you use Projects AI to turn raw text into a structured project.

---

## How Access Works

1. **Your API key** — If you add your own AI API key in Settings → AI, Projects AI runs without charging Jot credits.
2. **Credits balance** — If no API key, Projects AI uses your Jot credits for each conversion. We estimate the cost up front.
3. **Ad rewards** — If you are low on credits, you can watch a rewarded ad to earn credits and rerun the action.

## Costs in Plain English

- Costs scale with text size and model choice. Short briefs (a few hundred words) usually land in the low single-digit credits.
- We estimate the credit cost before running; you will see a shortfall message if you do not have enough.
- Credits are only deducted after a successful AI result. Failures do **not** charge credits.

**Using your own API key**

- Adds zero credit cost inside Jot. You are billed directly by your AI provider.
- Keep your provider limits in mind; Jot will still show estimated usage, but it will not deduct Jot credits.

## Earning Credits with Ads

- **Reward:** +5 credits per rewarded ad
- **Limits:** Up to 10 ads per day; 5-minute cooldown between ads
- **Leftover credits:** If the conversion costs less than 5 credits, you keep the remainder for later
- **Opt out:** You can disable ads in Settings → AI Credits. If opted out, ads are not shown.

**Flow when you are short on credits**

1. Projects AI shows the estimated cost and how many credits you are missing.
2. Choose **Watch Ad to Unlock** to earn credits.
3. After the ad finishes, rerun the conversion; any leftover credits stay in your balance.

## Common Scenarios

- **I have 0 credits** → Watch an ad (earns 5 credits) or add credits in AI Credits.
- **Ad button is disabled** → Daily limit reached, cooldown not finished, or ads are disabled in Settings.
- **Using API key but still see credits** → Estimator still shows cost for transparency; no credits are charged when an API key is active.
- **Large paste (multi-page)** → Cost will be higher; ensure you have enough credits or run after watching multiple ads.

## Tips to Reduce Cost

- Keep inputs concise (remove duplicates/attachments before running).
- Run Projects AI once, then edit the generated project manually.
- Switch to a lighter model (e.g., Gemini Flash or GPT-4o mini) in AI settings for cheaper runs.
- Use your own API key if you prefer direct billing.

## Quick Steps

1. Go to Projects AI and paste your raw text.
2. Review the estimated credit cost.
3. If short on credits, watch an ad or buy credits.
4. Run the AI conversion and review the structured project.
